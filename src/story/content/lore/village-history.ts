    "Millhaven was founded three centuries ago by a band of settlers who fled the coastal wars. " +
    "They followed the river upstream until they found this valley — a sheltered pocket between " +
    "the Thornwood Forest and the Greystone Mountains. The original mill, built on the river's " +
    "edge, still stands today, though it has been rebuilt twice after floods. The villagers maintain " +
    "a deep respect for the forest, believing the ancient trees harbor protective spirits. Every " +
    "autumn, they hold the Festival of Leaves to honor this bond.",
